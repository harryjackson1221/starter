Starter child theme for the BoldGrid Theme Framework

This is not a complete theme, but more or less a demo of how to go about doing different things with the BoldGrid Theme Framework and Prime parent theme.

This demo just shows what my own workflow would have been to create a simple site in an agency environment.  The goal was to build a site in less than 4 hours that gave decent results, so not much attention was given to responsiveness or code quality.

The demo of this theme's progress can be seen at: http://shared-dev.boldgrid.com/starter-demo/
